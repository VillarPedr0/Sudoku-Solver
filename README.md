# Sudoku Solver
 
## Overview
Welcome to the Sudoku Solver repository! This project began as a personal endeavor, driven by the passion for problem-solving and logical thinking. Initially developed in C++ utilizing an efficient backtracking algorithm, the solver can crack even the most challenging Sudoku puzzles. In the spirit of continuous improvement, the project is currently undergoing a migration to Java. This transition aims to introduce an intuitive and interactive user interface, making the solver more accessible and engaging.

## Features
- C++ to Java Migration: The solver is in the process of being migrated from C++ to Java to facilitate the incorporation of an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).

- Backtracking Algorithm: The heart of this project lies in its backtracking algorithm. This robust technique enables the solver to systematically explore possibilities and find solutions for Sudoku puzzles of varying complexities.

- Universal Sudoku Solving: Regardless of the difficulty level, this solver can tackle any Sudoku puzzle. From easy boards to mind-bending ones, the solver's algorithm adapts to the challenge at hand.

- Interactive Interface (Work in Progress): The ongoing migration to Java includes the integration of an interactive GUI. This enhancement will allow users to input their Sudoku puzzles effortlessly, visualize the solving process, and witness the solution unfold in real-time.

## How to Use
1 - **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VillarPedr0/Sudoku-Solver.git
```

2 - **Compile and Run**: If you have Java installed, navigate to the project directory and compile the Java files. Run the main program to launch the interactive Sudoku Solver.

3 - **Input Your Puzzle**: Use the graphical interface to input the initial Sudoku puzzle you want to solve.

4 - **Watch the Magic Unfold**: Once you provide the initial configuration, sit back and watch as the solver employs its backtracking algorithm to crack the puzzle. The interactive interface will illustrate each step of the solving process.

5 - **Celebrate the Victory**: Witness the solver's triumphant solution to the Sudoku puzzle. Feel free to explore other puzzles and difficulty levels to witness the solver's versatility.

## Project Status
This project is actively being developed and enhanced. The migration from C++ to Java, along with the integration of the interactive interface, is ongoing. Regular updates will be made to the repository as new features are integrated and improvements are achieved.
